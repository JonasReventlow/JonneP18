- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonas Reventlow Petersen 

- 👀 I’m interested in culture, human beings and prehistory and therefore has a bachelor's degree in prehistoric archeology. 
I am particularly interested in the interdisciplinary element, where archeology collaborates and contributes to other professions.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning archaeological related knowledge. Especially with a focus on museology, evolution and archeological theory. 
In the IT perspective, most of the learning goes on in C# and Python as it is related to my work and hobbies. I am studying my master in archaeology, where the combination of science, humanities and IT is in focus.

- 🧠 I’m looking foward to work on software and hardware development as are part of scientific projects.
So far, I have tried my game development in Unity, where archeology is responsible for giving the game a historical credibility.
In addition, I have focused on language technology and frequency analysis using Anaconda
I want to start focusing on work with categorizing and optimizing of image and object recognition and the use of programming in our understanding of evolution from an archaeological perspective.
