- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jonas Reventlow Petersen 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in culture, human beings and prehistory and therefore has a masters's degree in prehistoric archeology. 
I am particularly interested in the interdisciplinary element, where archaeology collaborates and contributes to other professions.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning archaeological related knowledge. Especially with a focus on evolution, cultural complexity and archeological theory. 
In the digital perspective, most of the learning goes on in C# and Python as it is related to my work and hobbies. I am particularly interested in Digital Twins, networks of cultural data and the combination of qualitative and quantitative tools.

- ðŸ§  Iâ€™m looking foward to work on software and hardware development as part of scientific projects.
So far, I have tried my game development in Unity, where archaeology is responsible for giving the game a historical credibility and visualize the complexity that forms the framework for an object's existence.
In addition, I have focused on language technology and frequency analysis using Anaconda.
I want to start focusing on work with categorizing and optimizing of image and object recognition and the use of programming in our understanding of evolution from an archaeological perspective.
